        <h1>Introduction of China Import and Export Fair</h1>
        <p>China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, is established in 1957. Co-hosted by the Ministry of
            Commerce of PRC and the People’s Government of Guangdong Province and organized by China Foreign Trade
            Centre, it is held every spring and autumn in Guangzhou, China. Canton Fair is a comprehensive international
            trading event with the longest history, the largest scale, the most complete exhibit variety, the largest
            buyer attendance, the broadest distribution of buyers’ source country and the greatest business turnover in
            China.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After 61 years’ reform and innovative development, the Canton Fair has withstood various challenges and never
            been interrupted. The Canton Fair enhances trade connection between China and the world, demonstrating
            China’s image and achievements of development. It is an outstanding platform for Chinese enterprises to
            explore the international market and an exemplary base to implement China’s strategies for foreign trade
            growth. The Canton Fair serves as the first and foremost platform to promote China’s foreign trade, and a
            barometer of the foreign trade sector. It is the window, epitome and symbol of China’s opening up.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Up to the 123rd session, the accumulated export volume has amounted to about USD 1.3237 trillion and the
            total number of overseas buyers has reached 8.42 million. The exhibition area of one session totals 1.185
            million m2 and the number of exhibitors from home and abroad stands at nearly 25,000. In each session, about
            200,000 buyers attend the Fair from more than 210 countries and regions all over the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the opening of the 120th Canton Fair in October, 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory
            letter; Chinese Premier Li Keqiang gave instructions. The congratulatory letter of President Xi and
            instructions of Premier Li affirm the Canton Fair’s important status and contributions in China’s reform and
            opening up and eco-social development and point out the key and direction of our work, significant for
            expanding China’s opening up, cultivating new competitive edges of foreign trade sector, building China into
            a strong economic and trade power, and driving reform and innovation at the Canton Fair.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At present, following the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
            Era, we, at the Canton Fair, will study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC Congress, uphold the
            development principle of innovation, coordination, green development, openness, and sharing, and spur
            innovation in the system and business mode. We are continuously improving specialization,</p>
        <br>
        <p>information application, market orientation, and international development. We are endeavored to build a
            “Smart Canton Fair” and “Green Canton Fair”. We are working hard to transform Canton Fair from an export
            trading platform to a comprehensive one integrating customer networking, display and negotiation, industrial
            exchange, information release and product promotion. We will give full play to Canton Fair’s function as an
            overall platform for opening-up which allows for buying and selling to the globe, and make new contributions
            to China’s development into a strong economic and trade power and the development of open economy.</p>
